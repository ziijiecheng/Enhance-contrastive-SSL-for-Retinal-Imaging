Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Analysis (MIDL 2025)
This is the official repository for the MIDL 2025 paper: [Enhancing Contrastive Learning for Retinal Imaging via Adjusted Augmentation Scales].

This work introduces an adjusted augmentation strategy for contrastive learning in retinal imaging, improving downstream classification performance.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Follow these steps to set up the required Conda environment:

1. Create the environment (Name: dino, Python 3.10)
conda create --name dino python=3.10

2. Activate the environment
conda activate dino

3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# üíæ Pre-trained Checkpoints
The following pre-trained checkpoints are provided, each corresponding to a different data augmentation strategy used during the initial self-supervised training phase:

Augmentation Strategy	Checkpoint File	Download Link
Strong Augmentation (ckp-300)	ckp-300.pth	Download
Weak Augmentation (ckp-325)	ckp-325.pth	Download
Weak + Medium Augmentation (ckp-350)	ckp-350.pth	Download

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage: Fine-tuning & Evaluation
1. Dataset Preparation
This work uses the APTOS2019 Blindness Detection dataset.

Download the dataset from the official Kaggle competition page:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data

Unzip and organize the dataset into a directory.

You will need to provide the path to this directory in the --data_path argument.

2. Run Fine-tuning
You can run the evaluation using the provided eval.sh script or by directly executing the torchrun command.

The example below demonstrates a 50-epoch fine-tuning run on the APTOS2019 dataset using the strong augmentation checkpoint (ckp-300.pth).

Bash

torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 --master_port=48793 eval_finetune.py \
--data_path /path/to/your/APTOS2019 \
--pretrained_weights ./ckp-300.pth \
--task dino_finetune_APTOS2019/ \
--num_labels 5 \
--arch vit_small \
--batch_size_per_gpu 16 \
--epochs 50
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: You must modify the --data_path argument to point to the root directory of the APTOS2019 dataset on your system.
